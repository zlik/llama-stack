            ## Tokens
            Here is a list of special tokens that are supported by Llama 3.1:
            - `<|begin_of_text|>`: Specifies the start of the prompt
            - `<|end_of_text|>`: Model will cease to generate more tokens. This token is generated only by the base models.
            - `<|finetune_right_pad_id|>`: This token is used for padding text sequences to the same length in a batch.
            - `<|start_header_id|>` and `<|end_header_id|>`: These tokens enclose the role for a particular message. The possible roles are: [system, user, assistant and tool]
            - `<|eom_id|>`: End of message. A message represents a possible stopping point for execution where the model can inform the executor that a tool call needs to be made. This is used for multi-step interactions between the model and any available tools. This token is emitted by the model when the Environment: ipython instruction is used in the system prompt, or if the model calls for a built-in tool.
            - `<|eot_id|>`: End of turn. Represents when the model has determined that it has finished interacting with the user message that initiated its response. This is used in two scenarios:
                - at the end of a direct interaction between the model and the user
                - at the end of multiple interactions between the model and any available tools
                This token signals to the executor that the model has finished generating a response.
            - `<|python_tag|>`: Is a special tag used in the model's response to signify a tool call.

            - `user`: Represents the human interacting with the model. It includes the inputs, commands, and questions to the model.
            - `tool`: A new role introduced in Llama 3.1. This role is used to mark messages with the output of a tool call when sent back to the model from the executor. (The actual token used by the model for this role is "ipython".)
