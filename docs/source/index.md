# Llama Stack


Llama Stack defines and standardizes the core building blocks needed to bring generative AI applications to market. It provides a unified set of APIs with implementations from leading service providers, enabling seamless transitions between development and production environments. More specifically, it provides

- **Unified API layer** for Inference, RAG, Agents, Tools, Safety, Evals, and Telemetry.
- **Plugin architecture** to support the rich ecosystem of implementations of the different APIs in different environments like local development, on-premises, cloud, and mobile.
- **Prepackaged verified distributions** which offer a one-stop solution for developers to get started quickly and reliably in any environment
- **Multiple developer interfaces** like CLI and SDKs for Python, Node, iOS, and Android
- **Standalone applications** as examples for how to build production-grade AI applications with Llama Stack

Our goal is to provide pre-packaged implementations (aka "distributions") which can be run in a variety of deployment environments. LlamaStack can assist you in your entire app development lifecycle - start iterating on local, mobile or desktop and seamlessly transition to on-prem or public cloud deployments. At every point in this transition, the same set of APIs and the same developer experience is available.

## Supported Llama Stack Implementations

A number of "adapters" are available for some popular Inference and Vector Store providers. For other APIs (particularly Safety and Agents), we provide *reference implementations* you can use to get started. We expect this list to grow over time. We are slowly onboarding more providers to the ecosystem as we get more confidence in the APIs.
